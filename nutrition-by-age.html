                    <li>Gives your child proper nutrition</li>
                    <li>Is right for your child's state of development</li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
                <p>
                    During the first 6 months of life, your baby needs only
                    breast milk or formula for proper nutrition.
                </p>
                <ul class="lists-weight">
                    <li>
                        Your baby will digest breast milk more quickly than
                        formula. So if you breastfeed, your newborn may need to
                        nurse 8 to 12 times per day, or every 2 to 3 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be sure you empty your breasts regularly by feeding or
                        using a breast pump. This will prevent them from
                        becoming overly full and achy. It will also allow you to
                        continue producing milk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you feed your baby formula, your baby will eat about
                        6 to 8 times per day, or every 2 to 4 hours. Start your
                        newborn with 1 to 2 ounces ( 30 to 60 mL) at every
                        feeding and gradually increase the feedings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feed your baby when they seem hungry. Signs include
                        smacking lips, making suckling movements, and rooting
                        (moving their head around to find your breast).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not wait until your baby cries to feed her. This
                        means she is very hungry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your baby should not sleep more than 4 hours at night
                        without feeding (4 to 5 hours if you are feeding
                        formula). It is OK to wake them up to feed them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are breastfeeding exclusively, ask your
                        pediatrician if you need to give your baby supplemental
                        vitamin D drops.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can tell if your baby is getting enough to eat if:</p>
                <ul class="lists-weight">
                    <li>
                        Never give honey to your infant. It may contain bacteria
                        that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not give your baby cow's milk until age 1 year.
                        Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's
                        milk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not feed your baby any solid food until 4 to 6 months
                        old. Your baby will not be able to digest it and may
                        choke.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can
                        cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them
                        a pacifier.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There are several ways you can tell that your infant is
                    ready to eat solid foods:
                </p>
                <ul class="lists-weight">
                    <li>Your baby's birth weight has doubled.</li>
                    <li>
                        Your baby can control their head and neck movements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your baby can sit up with some support.</li>
                    <li>
                        Your baby can show you they are full by turning their
                        head away or by not opening their mouth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your baby begins showing interest in food when others
                        are eating.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When to Call the Doctor</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Call the health care provider if you are concerned because
                    your baby:
                </p>
                <ul class="lists-weight">
                    <li>Is not eating enough</li>
                    <li>Is eating too much</li>
                    <li>Is gaining too much weight or little weight</li>
                    <li>Has an allergic reaction to food</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What is the best food for your baby?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Breast milk is the best food for babies. Babies who are
                    breastfed have a lower risk of developing ear infections,
                    colds, or chronic conditions, such as diabetes or other
                    diseases, and they tend to eat healthier throughout their
                    lives. Breast feeding can be hard and in certain situations,
                    it may not be possible. If you need help, there are support
                    systems listed below. If it is not possible to feed your
                    baby breast milk, infant formula will still provide balanced
                    nutrition.

                    While this website will only focus on what and how to feed
                    your baby when solid foods are introduced, it’s important to
                    continue breastmilk or formula until your baby is at least
                    one year old. For breastfeeding support, contact your local
                    birthing center or check out these resources:

                        foods?</strong

                <p>
                    Complementary foods are foods and beverages other than
                    breast milk or formula given to infants when they are
                    developmentally ready for them. They can be liquid,
                    semisolid or solid. Along with feeding breast milk or
                    formula, they help complete your baby’s nutritional needs.
                    The American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health
                    Organization recommends breast milk for the first 6 months,
                    before introducing complementary foods. Ideal nutrition,
                    protection from choking, and the maturity of your baby’s
                    digestive system are all factors that determine the
                    recommended age for starting complementary foods. The best
                    time to introduce complementary foods varies, because babies
                    may develop at different rates. It is important to tune into
                    your baby’s developmental readiness before you introduce
                    complementary foods.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Signs of Readiness</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Babies may open their mouths, lean forward and drool when
                    they are ready to receive complementary foods. If your baby
                    is not interested or full, do not force the feeding. Your
                    baby may turn away, close their mouth and push away the
                    spoon. Respect and follow these cues, which will lead to
                    healthy eating patterns throughout their life. Your baby
                    should have reached the following milestones before you
                    offer complementary foods.
                </p>
                <ol class="lists-weight">
                    <li>Holds their head up straight</li>
                    <li>Sits up with support</li>
                    <li>Shows interest in foods you are eating</li>
                    <li>Opens mouth to receive food</li>
                    <li>Closes lips over the spoon</li>
                    <li>
                        Swallows instead of pushing the food back out of their
                        mouth
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>A Window of Opportunity</strong></p>
                <p>
                    It’s important to not start complementary foods too
                    early-before 4 months of age-for three reasons:
                </p>
                <ol class="lists-weight">
                    <li>Increased risk of choking</li>

                    <li>Increased risk of obesity</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Likewise, introducing complementary foods too late-after 6
                    months of age-may experience the following problems:

                    The foods and drinks your preschooler has throughout the day
                    are important for his or her health. Fruits, vegetables,
                    grains, protein foods, and dairy are a part of a healthy
                    eating style and together provide the nutrients their bodies
                    need. Limit the amount of added sugars, sodium, and

                    It’s simply another step in the process of growing up and
                    becoming independent. As long as your preschooler is
                    healthy, growing normally, and has plenty of energy, he or
                    she is most likely getting the nutrients he or she needs.<br />

                <p>
                    Many children will show one or more of the following
                    behaviors during the preschool years. In most cases, these
                    will go away with time.

                        Your child may refuse a food based on a certain color or
                        texture. For example, he or she could refuse foods that
                        are red or green, contain seeds, or are squishy.

                        For a period of time, your preschooler may only eat a
                        certain type of food. Your child may choose 1 or 2 foods
                        he or she likes and refuse to eat anything else.

                        normal for your preschooler to prefer familiar foods and

                <p>
                    Your child may not want to try new foods. It is normal for

                        kids try small portions of new foods that you enjoy.
                        Give them a small taste at first and be patient with
                        them. When they develop a taste for more types of foods,
                        it’s easier to plan family meals.&nbsp;

                        Offer only one new food at a time. 
                        Serve something that you know your child likes along
                        with the new food. Offering more new foods all at once
                        could be too much for your child.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be a good role model. Try new foods
                        yourself. Describe their taste, texture, and smell to
                        your child.

                    <li>
                        Offer new foods first. Your child is

                        Sometimes, new foods take time. Kids
                        don’t always take to new foods right away. Offer new
                        foods many times. It may take up to a dozen tries for a
                        child to accept a new food.&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Healthy breakfasts are a must for kids and help keep them going strong all day. This article and short video provide tips on making it happen.</p>
                    </div>



                    <p>A healthy breakfast is a must for kids. Skip it and your kids will be playing nutritional catch-up for the rest of the day, says Carole L. Adler, M.A., R.D., a dietitian at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><br>

                    <p>When kids skip breakfast, they don't get what they need to be at their best, says Adler. “Growing bodies and developing brains need regular, healthy meals,” she says. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, studies show that school children who eat breakfast perform better in the classroom.</p><br>

                    <p>As with other meals, it’s a good idea for your kids (and you) to eat a healthy balance of fruits and vegetables, proteins, grains and dairy—not just for breakfast but throughout the day.</p><br>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><u>Here are Adler’s seven quick and easy breakfast tips to ensure your children start their day off right.</u></strong></p><br>

                    <p><strong>Breakfast doesn’t have to mean traditional breakfast foods.</strong></p>

                    <p>Anything goes, as long as you maintain a healthy balance. So if your kids want a change from cereal and eggs, think about serving left-overs from last night’s dinner. There’s nothing wrong with tuna fish with celery on a whole wheat English muffin or a turkey sandwich to start the day.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Give kids foods they like.</strong></p>

                    <p>It’s neither necessary nor effective to feed them foods they dislike. Do your kids turn up their noses at vegetables but love pizza? Left-over pizza with a whole-grain crust and veggies works for breakfast, too. Or make muffins with zucchini and carrots, and spread with peanut butter or almond butter for protein with a glass of milk. Your kids love sugary cereal? Mix a little bit of that cereal with a whole-grain, nutrient-packed healthier brand of cereal. “Nothing has to be off the table altogether, and sometimes just a taste of something your kids like is enough to keep them happy,” Adler says.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Make healthy trade-offs.</strong></p>

                    <p>Keep in mind that nutritional balance is key—not just for one meal but for foods eaten throughout the day. Not enough vegetables in the morning meal? Prepare extra carrot, celery, and broccoli sticks with a hummus dip as an afternoon snack.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Take growth and activity levels into account.</strong></p>

                    <p>Growing bodies need nourishment. And if your kids are physically active to boot, they need plenty of calories to keep them fueled. Adler says that having a breakfast that contains protein, fat and carbohydrates helps children feel full and stay focused until lunch. Protein choices might include an egg, some nuts, a slice of deli meat or cheese, or a container of yogurt.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Help your children make healthy choices, even if they’re on the run.</strong></p>

                    <p>When time is short, hand your kids something healthy as they head out the door, like a piece of fruit, a bag of nut-and-fruit trail mix, or a whole-wheat tortilla spread with peanut butter or almond butter, and a carton of milk. “A fruit-filled shake with milk or yogurt takes only a couple of minutes to drink,” Adler says.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Prep the night before.</strong></p>

                    <p>Morning is a busy time for everyone—you included. So take ten minutes to think ahead and prep for breakfast the night before. Chop up fruit to layer in a yogurt parfait or add to cereal. Cut up vegetables for an omelet. Mix up muffin or whole-grain waffle batter, cover, and put in the fridge. Get out a pan for pancakes or a blender for smoothies. Put a bowl of nut-and-fruit trail mix on the table for kids to grab a handful as they walk out the door.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Use the Nutrition Facts label and ingredient statement when you shop.</strong></p>

                    <p>“The label makes it easy to determine the amounts of nutrients your kids are getting and to compare one product to another,” Adler says. Make sure your children get nutrient-dense foods that are low in salt and added sugars.</p><br>
