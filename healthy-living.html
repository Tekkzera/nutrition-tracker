                    Weight loss can be achieved either by eating fewer calories
                    or by burning more calories with physical activity,
                    preferably both.
                </p>
                <p>A healthy weight loss program consists of:</p>
                <ul class="lists-weight">
                    <li>A reasonable, realistic, weight loss goal</li>
                    <li>
                        A reduced calorie, nutritionally-balanced eating plan
                    </li>
                    <li>Regular physical activity</li>
                    <li>
                        A behavior change plan to help you stay on track with
                        your goals

                <ul class = "lists-weight">
                    <li>
                        Check your Body Mass Index (BMI) - an indicator of body
                        fat - and see where it fits within the BMI categories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Discuss weight loss with your doctor and decide on a
                        goal. If you have a lot of weight to lose, set a
                        realistic intermediate goal, maybe to lose 10 pounds.
                        Remember that even a small amount of weight loss can
                        lead to big health benefits.

                        Keep in mind that you want to develop lifestyle habits
                        that will help you maintain your weight in a healthy
                        range. A short-term "diet" that you "go on" and then "go
                        off" is not the answer to long-term weight management.

                <p><strong>Staying on Track With Your Goals</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Setting realistic goals and tracking your progress pare key
                    to your success. In fact, research has shown that those who
                    keep track of their behaviors are more likely to take off
                    weight and keep it off. A reasonable rate of weight loss is
                    1 to 2 pounds per week.
                </p>
                <h1 id="title-weight"><strong>Weight Control</strong></h1>
            <p>More than two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in the United 
            States are overweight or obese. Obesity or being overweight may increase
            the risk of many health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart
            disease, and certain cancers. If you’re pregnant, excess weight may lead to 
            short- and long-term health problems for you and your child. Achieving a 
            healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and being physically active can help
            prevent these weight-related diseases.</p>
            <p>
                Some people, in their efforts to lose weight, turn to unproven dietary 
                supplements (sometimes marketed as “fat burners” or appetite 
                suppressants), which can have harmful side effects. If you’re thinking
                about starting a new weight-loss program, talk with your health care 
                provider, who can assess your weight and health risks, determine 
                whether you need to lose weight, and provide information that will
                help you make informed decisions about an effective weight-loss
                program.</p>
            <p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
            <ul class="lists-weight">
                <li>Most dietary supplements marketed for rapid weight loss, such as acai and hoodia, don’t work for keeping weight off in the long term, and some are dangerous. For example, ephedra, which was used in weight loss supplements, was banned because of unreasonable risk of injury or illness.</li>
                <li>Researchers have studied the weight loss potential of a variety of dietary supplements, including omega-3s and fish oil; chitosan, a dietary fiber from shellfish; green tea extracts; Chinese herbs; and bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) extract. None have been shown to be effective for weight loss, and each of these has side effects.</li>
                <li>There’s some emerging evidence suggesting that some mind and body approaches, such as yoga and meditation, particularly mindful eating, may be useful as complements to other weight-loss interventions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
            <ul class="lists-weight">
                <li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra, which was marketed for weight loss, because of serious health risks, such as cardiovascular complications and even risk of death. Ephedra is also called ma huang.</li>
                <li>Many ephedra-free supplements are now being sold, but side effects of some of their ingredients are similar to the banned products. Some ephedra-free supplements also have a lot of caffeine or herbs, such as guarana, that contain caffeine. The products can cause increased heart rate and abnormal heart rhythms.</li>
                <li>Many dietary supplements marketed for weight-loss (including ones sold as “fat burners” or appetite suppressants) have not been tested for safety.</li>
                <li>What’s on the label may not be what’s in the bottle. Analyses of dietary supplements, including herbal supplements, sometimes find differences between labeled and actual ingredients. Also, the FDA has found weight-loss products tainted with prescription drug ingredients.</li>
                <li>Dietary supplements for weight loss are sometimes misused by people with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, to lose weight or induce vomiting.</li>
                <li>If you’re considering a dietary supplement for weight loss, remember that “natural” does not necessarily mean “safe.”</li>
                <li>Mind and body practices, such as meditation and yoga, are generally considered safe for healthy people when practiced appropriately under the guidance of a well-trained instructor. If you have any underlying health conditions, talk to your health care provider about any complementary approach you may be interested in using.</li>

            <h1 id="title-weight"><strong>Healthy Principles for Weight Gain</strong></h1>
            <p>Gaining weight may strengthen your immunity system and increase your energy level. So what can you do?</p>
            <p>Whether it’s been a life-long struggle to keep weight on or you’ve recently had a surgery or health concern leading to weight loss, you may find yourself or a loved one struggling to reach an optimum weight.</p><br>
            <p>Increasing your weight to an optimal level may have important health benefits, such as boosting your immune system and your energy level. So, how do you gain healthy weight?</p><br>
            <p>Increasing calories with key nutrients as opposed to filling up on sugary, salty or processed snacks can be an effective weight gain practice. Calorie consumption recommendations based on gender, age and activity level range from 1,600 calories a day for inactive senior women, to 2,400 calories a day for active senior men. ChooseMyPlate.gov has resources and tools for individual calculations.</p><br>
            <p>The bottom line is that you need to eat more calories than your body needs. However, it’s still important to do so by opting for whole, minimally processed foods that are naturally high in calories. Avoid trying to gain weight by overdoing the highly processed, high-energy, nutrient-poor foods like chips, cookies, pastries and sweets.</p><br>
            <p>Switch two percent or whole milk, and/or non-fat dry milk powder for your current liquids, soups, gravies and smoothies. Including high protein cottage cheese, yogurt and cheese for snacks will help you reach your daily recommendations for dairy and protein. Milk items pair nicely with fruits and vegetables, which may help you eat or drink more.</p><br>
            <p>Choose weight bearing exercise. Even in small increments (10 minutes) several times a week, you will be building muscle, which weighs more than fat.</p><br>
            <p>Gaining healthy weight may strengthen your immune system and overall energy level. For some people, healthy weight gain is a life-long struggle, for others they may have recently underwent a surgery or have another health concern leading to weight loss, or it could be a loved one struggling to reach an optimum weight.</p><br>
            <p>Create routines to make meal-time a focus. You or a loved one will be less tempted to skip meals if you plan specific places (outdoors picnic area, senior center, dining table) or a brown bag lunch with family or friends. When you mindfully think about food as opposed to being distracted or preoccupied you will become more aware of your hunger cues. Eat with your family and friends or make a social experience out of meal-time. You may even try to snack between meals on protein and calorie rich snacks such as nuts, yogurt, peanut butter and guacamole.</p><br>
            <p>Stock up on favorites. If you have items on hand that you like you will likely “feel” like eating. Try low preparation foods such as sweet potatoes or spaghetti squash that you can bake in the microwave. Canned tuna or salmon, beans and canned tomatoes can be added easily to create salads, chili or sauces. Making your favorite recipes will inspire a stronger appetite. Smells and interaction with food during preparation will trigger your hunger cues.</p><br>
            <p>Try to pair your favorite foods with other foods that are high in nutrients. Salsas, sauces or vegetables (for example, baked sweet potatoes) may encourage you to eat portions of lean proteins.</p><br>
            <p>Appearance is everything—when it comes to food anyway. Whether in a five star restaurant or your home dining table, the more colorful and visually stimulating, the more likely you will be to try it and eat more of it.</p><br>
            <p>Limit your consumption of liquids during meals and focus on nutrient-rich beverages between meals, such as milk, juice, smoothies or even meal replacement shakes (if directed by your physician or registered dietician).</p><br>
