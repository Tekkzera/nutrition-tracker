		<h2><strong>Plan Your Weekly Meals</strong></h2><br>
		<p>Before making a grocery list, write down meals you want to make this week. Buying for the week means you’ll make fewer shopping trips and buy only the items you need.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Here are some basic tips for creating your menu and grocery list:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>See what you already have. </strong>Look in your freezer, cabinets, and refrigerator. Make a note of what you currently have on hand. You can save money by using these items in the upcoming week’s meals.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Use a worksheet to plan your meals. </strong>The <strong>Create a Grocery Game Plan Worksheet</strong> is great for planning your week and figuring out what items you may need to buy.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Create a list of recipes to try.</strong> Find new ideas for healthy and low-cost meals based on what you have on hand, foods your family enjoys, and foods that are good buys.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Visit MyPlate Kitchen&nbsp;for recipe inspiration.</strong> Search recipes by ingredient using MyPlate Kitchen&nbsp;-- an interactive tool to help with healthy meal planning, cooking, and grocery shopping. Be sure to include some family favorites along with the new recipes.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Think about your schedule. </strong>Choose meals you can easily prepare when you don’t have a lot of time. Save recipes that take longer for days off. You also can prepare meals in advance to heat and serve on your busiest days.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Plan to use leftovers. </strong>Think about larger recipes with enough servings for multiple meals. This can reduce the number of ingredients you need to buy, and save you time preparing another meal.&nbsp;</p>
		</li>

					<h2><strong>Save More at the Store</h2></strong></h2><br>
		<p>The smartest shoppers know that saving money is more than luck. When shopping for groceries, it’s about having a game plan and making smart decisions about what to put in your cart.<br>
		&nbsp;</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Ask for advice. </strong>Grocery stores, ethnic markets, dollar stores, retail supercenters, and wholesale clubs can offer good deals. Ask friends and family where they shop and find their best bargains!<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Eat before you shop.</strong> Grocery shopping hungry can lead to impulse buying and unhealthy food choices.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Read the sales flyer.</strong> Sales flyers are usually released mid-week and can be found at the store’s entrance, in the newspaper, or on their website.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Use coupons</strong> – but only for items that you know you’ll use. If you don’t need an item right away, save the coupon and see if it goes on sale. &nbsp;For more on couponing, check out Save More at the Grocery Store.&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Look up and down for savings.</strong> Stores often stock the priciest items at eye level. You can save big by looking at the upper and lower shelves too.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Check for store brands.</strong> Most stores offer their own brand of products that often cost less than name brands.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Grab from the back.</strong> Stores typically stock shelves from back to front, placing the newest items behind the older ones. Reach in the back for the freshest items especially in the produce, dairy, and meat aisles.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Ask for a rain check. </strong>If a sale item has run out, ask the store for a rain check. This allows you to pay the sale price after the item is restocked.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Join your store’s loyalty program.</strong> Most stores offer a free loyalty program. Get special offers and discounts that non-members do not.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Think outside the store.</strong> Farmers markets and farm stands can be great options for picking up fresh produce at a discount.&nbsp; Check the National Farmers Market Directory for locations near you.<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		</li>

		  <h2><strong>Read the Food Label</strong></h2><br>	
		  <p>Food labels tell you the nutritional content of a food item. You can compare two different items by using the Nutrition Facts label to choose the healthier option.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Use the Nutrition Facts label to compare food choices. </strong>The example above shows two soup options. The Nutrition Facts labels show us that the reduced-sodium vegetable soup has less sodium per serving than the original vegetable soup -- in this case half the amount. This makes the reduced-sodium vegetable soup the healthier choice, as long as the serving sizes are about the same size.</p>
		  
		  <br>
		  <h2><strong>Kitchen Timesavers</strong></h2><br>
		  <p>Try these kitchen timesavers to cut back on time and make less work for you. By taking the stress and hassle out of cooking, you’ll have more time to enjoy it and to spend with your loved ones.&nbsp;<br>
		  &nbsp;</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Organize your kitchen.</strong> Keep frequently used items such as cooking oils/sprays, spatulas, cutting boards, and spices within easy reach. This will save you from having to search for them later.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Clear the clutter</strong>. Before you start cooking, clear off your counters. This allows more room for prep space.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Chop extra.</strong> When chopping up veggies for a meal, chop more than you need. Take the extra, place in a reusable container and freeze. Then next time you need it, you can skip a step.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Have everything in place</strong>. Grab all ingredients needed for your meal – chopped vegetables, measured spices, and thawed meats. It will be easier to spot missing items and avoid skipping steps.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Double your recipe.</strong> For your next casserole or stew, try doubling the recipe and freezing the extra. You’ll save time and make cooking next week’s dinner a snap!</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Clean as you go</strong>. Fill up the sink with soapy water and wash the dishes as you cook. It’ll make clean up go much smoother!</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  <p><strong>Save some for later</strong>. Freeze leftover soups, sauces, or gravies in small reusable containers.&nbsp;</p>
		  </li>
		  </ol>
