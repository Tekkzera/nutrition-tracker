        <p>
          This fact sheet provides an overview of selected ingredients in
          dietary supplements designed or claimed to enhance exercise and
          athletic performance. Manufacturers and sellers promote these
          products, sometimes referred to as “ergogenic aids,” by claiming that
          they improve strength or endurance, increase exercise efficiency,
          achieve a performance goal more quickly, and increase tolerance for
          more intense training. These effects are the main focus of this fact
          sheet. Some people also use ergogenic aids to prepare the body for
          exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, and enhance
          recovery from exercise [<a href="#en1" class="fscopy_nounderline">1</a

        </p>

        <p>
          Dietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance come
          in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, powders,
          and bars. Many of these products contain numerous ingredients in
          varied combinations and amounts. Among the more common ingredients are
          amino acids, protein, creatine, and caffeine. According to one
          estimate, retail sales of the category of “sports nutrition
          supplements” totaled $5.67 billion in 2016, or 13.8% of $41.16 billion
          total sales for dietary supplements and related nutrition products for
          that year [<a href="#en3" class="fscopy_nounderline">3</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Several surveys have indicated the extent of dietary supplement use
          for bodybuilding and to enhance exercise and athletic performance:
        </p>

        <ul class="lists-weight">
          <li>
            International surveys found that two-thirds of 3,887 adult and
            adolescent elite track and field athletes participating in
            world-championship competitions took one or more dietary supplements
            containing such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, creatine,
            caffeine, and amino acids [<a href="#en4" class="fscopy_nounderline"
              >4</a
            >]. Supplement use increased with age and was significantly more
            common among women than men.
          </li>
          <li>
            A survey of 1,248 students aged 16 years or older in five U.S.
            colleges and universities in 2009–2010 found that 66% reported use
            of any dietary supplement. The reasons for use included enhanced
            muscle strength (20% of users), performance enhancement (19% of
            users), and increased endurance (7% of users) [<a
              href="#en5"
              class="fscopy_nounderline"
              >5</a
            >]. Products taken for these purposes included protein, amino acids,
            herbal supplements, caffeine, creatine, and combination products.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a national survey of about 21,000 U.S. college athletes,
            respondents reported taking protein products (41.7%), energy drinks
            and shots (28.6%), creatine (14.0%), amino acids (12.1%),
            multivitamins with caffeine (5.7%), beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate
            (HMB; 0.2%), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 0.1%), and an unspecified
            mix of “testosterone boosters” (1.6%) [<a
              href="#en6"
              class="fscopy_nounderline"
              >6</a
            >]. Men were much more likely to take performance-enhancing products
            than women, except for energy drinks and shots. Among the sports
            with the highest percentage of users of performance-enhancing
            products were ice hockey, wrestling, and baseball among the men and
            volleyball, swimming, and ice hockey among the women.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a review of studies on adolescent use of performance-enhancing
            substances, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that
            protein, creatine, and caffeine were the most commonly used
            ingredients and that use increased with age [<a
              href="#en7"
              class="fscopy_nounderline"
              >7</a
            >]. Although athletes used these ingredients more than nonathletes,
            teenagers not involved in organized athletic activities often took
            them to enhance their appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            A survey of 106,698 U.S. military personnel in 2007–2008 found that
            22.8% of the men and 5.3% of the women reported using bodybuilding
            supplements, such as creatine and amino acids, and 40.5% of the men
            and 35.5% of the women reported using energy supplements that might
            contain caffeine and/or energy-enhancing herbs [<a
              href="#en8"
              class="fscopy_nounderline"
              >8</a
            >]. Use of these products was positively associated with deployment
            to combat situations, being younger than 29 years, being physically
            active, and reporting 5 or fewer hours of sleep a night.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is difficult to make generalizations about the extent of dietary
          supplement use by athletes because the studies on this topic are
          heterogeneous. But the data suggest that [<a
            href="#en9"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >9</a
          >]:
        </p>

        <ul class="lists-weight">
          <li>
            A larger proportion of athletes than the general U.S. population
            takes dietary supplements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Elite athletes (e.g., professional athletes and those who compete on
            a national or international level) use dietary supplements more
            often than their non-elite counterparts.
          </li>
          <li>
            The supplements used by male and female athletes are similar, except
            that a larger proportion of women use iron and a larger proportion
            of men take vitamin E, protein, and creatine.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For any individual to physically perform at his or her best, a
          nutritionally adequate diet and sufficient hydration are critical. The
          <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> [<a
            href="#en10"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >10</a
          >] and MyPlate [<a href="#en11" class="fscopy_nounderline">11</a>]
          recommend such an eating plan for everyone. Athletes require adequate
          daily amounts of calories, fluids, carbohydrates (to maintain blood
          glucose levels and replace muscle glycogen; typically 1.4 to 4.5 g/lb
          body weight [3 to 10 g/kg body weight]), protein (0.55 to 0.9 g/lb
          body weight [1.2 to 2.0 g/kg body weight]), fat (20% to 35% of total
          calories), and vitamins and minerals [<a
            href="#en12"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >12</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          A few dietary supplements might enhance performance only when they add
          to, but do not substitute for, this dietary foundation. Athletes
          engaging in endurance activities lasting more than an hour or
          performed in extreme environments (e.g., hot temperatures or high
          altitudes) might need to replace lost fluids and electrolytes and
          consume additional carbohydrates for energy. Even with proper
          nutritional preparation, the results of taking any dietary
          supplement(s) for exercise and athletic performance vary by level of
          training; the nature, intensity, and duration of the activity; and the
          environmental conditions [<a href="#en13" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >13</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          Sellers claim that dozens of ingredients in dietary supplements can
          enhance exercise and athletic performance. Well-trained elite and
          recreational athletes might use products containing one or more of
          these ingredients to train harder, improve performance, and achieve a
          competitive edge. However, the National Athletic Trainers’ Association
          acknowledges in a position statement that because the outcomes of
          studies of various performance-enhancing substances are often
          equivocal, using these substances can be “controversial and confusing”
          [<a href="#en14" class="fscopy_nounderline">14</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Most studies to assess the potential value and safety of supplements
          to enhance exercise and athletic performance include only conditioned
          athletes. Therefore, it is often not clear whether the supplements
          discussed in this fact sheet may be of value to recreational
          exercisers or individuals who engage in athletic activity only
          occasionally. In addition, much of the research on these supplements
          involves young adults (more often male than female), and not
          adolescents who may also use them against the advice of pediatric and
          high-school professional associations [<a
            href="#en7"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >7</a
          >,<a href="#en15" class="fscopy_nounderline">15</a>]. The quality of
          many studies is limited by their small samples and short durations,
          use of performance tests that do not simulate real-world conditions or
          are unreliable or irrelevant, and poor control of confounding
          variables [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>].
          Furthermore, the benefits and risks shown for the supplements might
          not apply to the supplement’s use to enhance types of physical
          performance not assessed in the studies. In most cases, additional
          research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of
          particular ingredients.

          Selected Ingredients in Dietary Supplements for Exercise and Athletic
          Performance
        </h2>

        <p>
          Many exercise and athletic-performance dietary supplements in the
          marketplace contain multiple ingredients (especially those marketed
          for muscle growth and strength). However, much of the research has
          focused only on single ingredients. One therefore cannot know or
          predict the effects and safety of combinations in these
          multi-ingredient products unless clinical trials have investigated
          that particular combination. Furthermore, the amounts of these
          ingredients vary widely among products. In some cases, the products
          contain proprietary blends of ingredients listed in order by weight,
          but labels do not provide the amount of each ingredient in the blend.
          Manufacturers and sellers of dietary supplements for exercise and
          athletic performance rarely fund or conduct scientific research on
          their proprietary products of a caliber that reputable biomedical
          journals require for publication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Table 1 briefly summarizes the findings discussed in more detail in
          this fact sheet on the safety and efficacy of selected ingredients in
          dietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Some
          research-derived data is available on these ingredients on which to
          base a judgment about their potential value to aid exercise and
          athletic performance. These dietary supplement ingredients are listed
          and discussed in the table, and in the text that follows the table, in
          alphabetical order.

          Exercise increases the body’s consumption of oxygen and induces
          oxidative stress, leading to the production of reactive oxygen and
          nitrogen species (i.e., free radicals) and the creation of more
          oxidized molecules in various tissues, including muscle. In theory,
          free radicals could impair exercise performance by impeding muscles’
          ability to produce force, thereby accelerating muscle damage and
          fatigue and producing inflammation and soreness [<a
            href="#en16"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >16-18</a
          >]. Some researchers have suggested that supplements containing
          antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>
          (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), could reduce this free-radical formation, thereby
          minimizing skeletal muscle damage and fatigue and promoting recovery
          [<a href="#en19" class="fscopy_nounderline">19</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Studies suggest that the use of large doses of
          antioxidant supplements, especially vitamins C and E, may actually
          reduce rather than promote some of the beneficial effects of exercise.
          One study, for example, randomly assigned 54 healthy Norwegian men and
          women aged 20–30 years, most of whom were recreational exercisers, to
          receive 1,000 mg vitamin C and 235 mg (about 520 IU) vitamin E as
          DL-alpha-tocopherol or a placebo daily for 11 weeks while engaging in
          an endurance training program consisting mostly of running. Compared
          with placebo, the supplements had no effect on maximal oxygen
          consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max, a measure of aerobic fitness and
          endurance capacity) or running performance. However, they
          significantly lowered levels of biochemical markers related to
          mitochondrial creation and exercise-induced cell signaling, thereby
          diminishing the desirable training-induced adaptations within skeletal
          muscle [<a href="#en20" class="fscopy_nounderline">20</a>]. The same
          research group conducted another trial using the same doses of
          vitamins C and E in 32 young men and women who followed a
          strength-training program for 10 weeks. Compared with placebo, the
          supplements did not affect muscle growth, but they significantly
          reduced the gain in arm strength as measured by biceps curls and
          blunted cellular signaling pathways linked to muscle hypertrophy [<a
            href="#en21"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >21</a
          >]. Another study randomly assigned 18 young men aged 20 to 34 years
          to receive 120 mg/day CoQ<sub>10</sub> for 22 days or a placebo [<a
            href="#en22"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >22</a
          >]. After 7 days of high-intensity cycling sprints, the CoQ<sub
            >10</sub
          >
          group had, on average, a significantly smaller improvement in mean
          power output than the placebo group, suggesting a poorer adaptation to
          training.
        </p>

        <p>
          The preponderance of research to date suggests that exercise-induced
          reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are beneficial. These free
          radicals induce adaptive changes in muscle that lead to greater
          production of mitochondria and hypertrophy of myofibers [<a

          cells to high concentrations of various antioxidant supplements (of
          which vitamins C and/or E have the most evidence) appears to blunt or
          block cell signaling and thereby inhibit some favorable physiological
          and physical adaptations to exercise. However, these adaptations might
          not prevent improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max or endurance performance
          [<a href="#en25" class="fscopy_nounderline">25</a>].

          <u>Safety</u>: Studies on the safety of vitamins C, E, and other
          antioxidant supplements taken during exercise show no evidence of
          adverse effects, aside from potentially reducing some of the benefits
          of exercise, but such studies have only lasted a few weeks or months.
          The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of vitamin C that the Food and
          Nutrition Board established as the maximum amount associated with
          little or no risk of adverse health effects is 1,800 mg/day for
          adolescents and 2,000 mg/day for adults [<a
            href="#en26"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >26</a
          >]. These amounts are substantially higher than the doses that studies
          have typically used for exercise and athletic performance. The UL of
          vitamin E, at 800 mg/day for adolescents and 1,000 mg/day (1,100–1,500
          IU) for adults, is likewise higher than the dose that these studies
          typically used [<a href="#en26" class="fscopy_nounderline">26</a>].

        <p>
          Among the potential adverse effects of excess vitamin C are diarrhea,
          nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. The
          intake of excessive amounts of vitamin E increases the risks of
          hemorrhagic effects. Moreover, results from a large clinical trial
          show that vitamin E supplements, even at doses below the UL (400
          IU/day taken for several years), might increase men’s risk of prostate
          cancer [<a href="#en27" class="fscopy_nounderline">27</a>]. The side
          effects of CoQ<sub>10</sub> are mild and can include fatigue,

        </p>

        <p>
          L-arginine is an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods,
          especially animal products and nuts. The typical dietary intake is 4–5
          grams/day [<a href="#en30" class="fscopy_nounderline">30</a>]. The
          body also synthesizes arginine (from citrulline), mainly in the
          kidneys.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some experts suggest that taking arginine in supplement form enhances
          exercise and athletic performance in several ways [<a
            href="#en30"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >30-32</a
          >]. First, some arginine is converted to nitric oxide, a potent
          vasodilator that can increase blood flow and the delivery of oxygen
          and nutrients to skeletal muscle. Second, increased vasodilation can
          speed up the removal of metabolic waste products related to muscle
          fatigue, such as lactate and ammonia, that the body produces during
          exercise. Third, arginine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of
          creatine, which helps supply muscle with energy for short-term,
          intense activity. Fourth, arginine may increase the secretion of human
          growth hormone (HGH), which in turn increases insulin-like growth
          factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, both of which stimulate muscle growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: The research to support supplemental arginine as a
          performance enhancer is limited and conflicting. Overall, it suggests
          that doses of 2–20 g/day arginine have little to no effect on
          performance in either anaerobic or aerobic exercise [<a
            href="#en30"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >30</a
          >,<a href="#en31" class="fscopy_nounderline">31</a>]. Furthermore,
          arginine typically had no effect on nitric oxide concentration, blood
          flow, or exercise metabolites (e.g., lactate and ammonia), especially
          when well-trained athletes—including cyclists, tennis players, and
          judo practitioners–took the supplement for 1–28 days [<a
            href="#en30"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >30</a
          >]. A recent review assessed 54 clinical studies examining the effects
          of arginine supplementation on strength performance, endurance, muscle
          blood volume and flow, cardiorespiratory measures, and nitric oxide
          production in healthy, active adults. The authors concluded that
          supplemental arginine (either alone or, more commonly, in combination
          with other ingredients, such as branched-chain amino acids [BCAAs] and
          lysine) provided little or no enhancement of athletic performance and
          did not improve recovery from exhaustion [<a
            href="#en33"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >33</a
          >]. Most of the studies included few participants, primarily young men
          aged 18–25 years (only four studies included women), and lasted only
          4–8 weeks (with none lasting 3 months or longer). In the 18 studies
          that compared arginine alone with a placebo, the most common doses
          were 2–10 g/day as a single dose and up to 20 g/day divided into three
          doses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research on the ability of supplemental arginine to raise HGH and
          IGF-1 serum concentrations also has had conflicting findings.
          Depending on the study (and therefore participants’ age, fitness
          level, and use of other supplements as well as the nature and duration
          of the exercise), extra arginine might either reduce HGH secretion [<a
            href="#en34"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >34</a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >35</a
          >]. Even raised HGH secretion, however, might not translate into more
          blood flow into muscle or greater protein synthesis [<a
            href="#en31"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >31</a
          >]. Little evidence shows supplemental arginine by itself increases
          muscle creatine concentrations or is superior or complementary to
          direct consumption of creatine [<a
            href="#en30"

        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Most study results suggest that up to 9 g/day arginine
          for several days or weeks is safe and well tolerated. At doses of 9–30
          g/day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions are
          gastrointestinal discomfort, such as diarrhea and nausea, and slightly
          reduced blood pressure [<a href="#en33" class="fscopy_nounderline"

          Beets are one of the richest food sources of inorganic nitrate.
          Ingested nitrate might enhance exercise and athletic performance in
          several ways, primarily through its conversion into nitric oxide in
          the body. Nitric acid is a potent vasodilator that can increase blood
          flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to skeletal muscle.
          Ingested nitrate might also enhance performance by dilating blood
          vessels in exercising muscle when oxygen levels decline, thereby
          increasing oxygen and nutrient delivery, reducing the oxygen cost of
          submaximal exercise, attenuating the adenosine triphosphate
          (ATP)-creatine phosphate energy system’s cost associated with skeletal
          muscle force production, and improving oxidative phosphorylation in
          mitochondria [<a href="#en40" class="fscopy_nounderline">40</a>,<a

          powdered form; the amount of nitrate can vary considerably among
          products.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: A growing number of clinical trials investigating
          beetroot juice or concentrate as an ergogenic aid have been published
          since 2007. Beetroot has generally improved performance and endurance
          to different extents compared with placebo among runners, swimmers,
          rowers, and cyclists in time trials and time-to-exhaustion tests, but
          not in all studies [<a href="#en40" class="fscopy_nounderline">40</a
          >,<a href="#en41" class="fscopy_nounderline">41-45</a>]. Performance
          benefits are more likely in recreationally active non-athletes than
          elite athletes [<a href="#en42" class="fscopy_nounderline">42</a>,<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"

          suggested a dose-response relationship [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >47</a
          >]. Although consuming beetroot juice concentrate on each of 4 days to
          supply 4.2 mmol nitrate (70 ml) provided no performance benefits
          compared with placebo, larger amounts of juice supplying 8.4 mmol
          nitrate (140 ml) did. However, consumption of even more beetroot juice
          supplying 16.8 mmol nitrate (280 ml) produced no further performance
          benefits. There has been little study of the effects of beetroot on
          anaerobic performance, such as high-volume resistance exercise with
          many repetitions [<a href="#en40" class="fscopy_nounderline">40</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          More research is needed to clarify the potential benefits of nitrate
          supplementation from beetroot juice on exercise and athletic
          performance and to determine the best doses and dosing protocols [<a
            href="#en48"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >48</a
          >]. No research has assessed longer-term supplementation with
          beetroot-derived nitrate beyond several weeks as an ergogenic aid.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Studies have not identified any safety concerns with
          the consumption of beetroot juice in moderate amounts (about 2
          cups/day) for several weeks. The amount of nitrate that this amount of
          juice provides is less than half the total nitrate consumption from a
          diet rich in vegetables and fruits [<a
            href="#en49"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >49</a
          >]. Although not a safety concern, beetroot consumption can color the
          urine pink or red due to the excretion of red pigments in the beets
          [<a href="#en50" class="fscopy_nounderline">50</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: In a position statement, the Academy of
          Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the Dietitians of Canada (DoC), and the
          American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) state that nitrate sources,
          such as beetroot juice, enhance exercise tolerance and economy and
          they improve endurance exercise performance in recreational athletes
          [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>]. The Australian
          Institute of Sport supports the use of beetroot juice for improving
          sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under the
          direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more
          research might be required to understand how the supplement should be
          used for best results [<a href="#en29" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >29</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          Most studies have used 500 ml/day (about 2 cups) of beetroot juice
          taken once (about 2.5 to 3 hours before exercise) or daily for up to
          15 days [<a href="#en40" class="fscopy_nounderline">40</a>]. This
          amount of juice provides about 5–11 mmol (or 310–682 mg) nitrate,
          depending on the product [<a href="#en41" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >41</a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >40</a

          these products are foods and not dietary supplements. Some dietary
          supplements contain beetroot powder in varying amounts, but studies
          have not assessed whether these are viable alternatives to beetroot

          <a id="beta-alanine"></a><strong><em>Beta-alanine</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Beta-alanine, a type of amino acid that the body does not incorporate
          into proteins, is the rate-limiting precursor to the synthesis of
          carnosine—a dipeptide of histidine and beta-alanine—in skeletal
          muscle. Carnosine helps buffer changes in muscle pH from the anaerobic
          glycolysis that provides energy during high-intensity exercise but
          results in the buildup of hydrogen ions as lactic acid accumulates and
          dissociates to form lactate, leading to reduced force and to fatigue
          [<a href="#en51" class="fscopy_nounderline">51</a>]. More carnosine in
          muscle leads to greater potential attenuation of exercise- induced
          reductions in pH, which could enhance performance of intense
          activities of short to moderate duration, such as rowing and swimming
          [<a href="#en52" class="fscopy_nounderline">52</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Beta-alanine is produced in the liver, and relatively small amounts
          are present in animal-based foods such as meat, poultry, and fish.
          Estimated dietary intakes range from none in vegans to about 1 g/day
          in heavy meat eaters [<a href="#en52" class="fscopy_nounderline">52</a
          >]. Carnosine is present in animal-based foods, such as beef and pork.
          However, oral consumption of carnosine is an inefficient method of
          increasing muscle carnosine concentrations because the dipeptide is
          digested into its constituent amino acids. Consumption of
          beta-alanine, in contrast, reliably increases the amount of carnosine
          in the body. Four to six grams of beta-alanine for 10 weeks, for
          example, can increase muscle carnosine levels by up to 80%, especially
          in trained athletes, although the magnitude of response differs widely
          [<a href="#en53" class="fscopy_nounderline">53</a>,<a
            href="#en54"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >54</a
          >]. For example, in one study of young, physically active but
          untrained adult men who took 4.8 g/day beta-alanine for 5–6 weeks, the
          percent increase in muscle carnosine content after 9 weeks of
          follow-up ranged from 2% to 69% [<a
            href="#en55"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >55</a
          >]. Among the “low responders,” the duration of the washout period
          when beta alanine concentrations returned to baseline values was less
          than half that for the “high responders” (6 weeks vs. 15 weeks).
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Studies have evaluated beta-alanine as a potential
          ergogenic aid with a variety of participants, exercise and activity
          protocols, and dosing regimens. Some studies suggest that beta-alanine
          consumption could provide small performance benefits in competitive
          events requiring high-intensity effort over a short period, such as
          rowing, swimming, and team sports (e.g., hockey and football) that
          involve repeated sprints and intermittent activity [<a

        <p>
          The authors of a Department of Defense-sponsored review concluded that
          the limited evidence from 20 human trials did not support consumption
          of beta-alanine (alone or in combination products) by active adults to
          enhance athletic performance or improve recovery from exercise-related
          exhaustion [<a href="#en59" class="fscopy_nounderline">59</a>]. Most
          of the studies in this review included young men aged 18–25 years who
          took 1.6–6.4 g/day beta-alanine supplements (in two to four separate
          servings) over 4–8 weeks. In contrast, the International Society of
          Sports Nutrition (ISSN) concluded from its literature review that
          beta- alanine supplements (4–6 g/day consumed for at least 2–4 weeks)
          can improve high-intensity exercise performance that lasts over 60
          seconds, especially in time-to-exhaustion tasks [<a
            href="#en54"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >54</a
          >]. However, performance benefits are more modest in exercise tests
          lasting more than 4 minutes because aerobic metabolic pathways
          increasingly meet energy demands. The ISSN called for more research to
          determine whether beta-alanine increases the strength and muscle mass
          that regular resistance exercise, such as weightlifting, can produce.

        <p>
          The authors of the most recent review of studies on beta-alanine’s
          effects on exercise concluded that supplementation has a statistically
          significant and positive effect on performance (including in both
          isolated-limb and whole-body exercises), especially in protocols
          lasting 30 seconds to 10 minutes [<a
            href="#en58"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >58</a
          >]. However, this review also highlighted the fact that small studies
          of short duration using varied exercise and supplement protocols
          dominate this scientific literature. The 40 placebo-controlled studies
          reviewed, for example, employed 65 exercise protocols and 70 exercise
          measures in a total of 1,461 participants. Furthermore, the total dose
          of beta-alanine that participants consumed ranged from 84 to 414 g in
          studies lasting 28–90 days.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Beta-alanine supplementation appears to be safe at
          1.6–6.4 g/day for up to 8 weeks [<a
            href="#en54"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >54</a
          >]. Some evidence does show, however, that consuming a conventional
          dose of beta-alanine of at least 800 mg or exceeding 10 mg/kg body
          mass can provoke moderate to severe paresthesia [<a
            href="#en54"

            >54</a

          prickling, or burning sensation is common in the face, neck, back of
          the hands, and upper trunk and typically lasts 60–90 minutes but is
          not a painful, serious, or harmful reaction. Use of divided doses or a
          sustained-release form of the supplement can attenuate paresthesia
          resulting from beta-alanine consumption [<a
            href="#en52"

            >52</a
          >,<a href="#en54" class="fscopy_nounderline">54</a>]. Some research
          has also found that beta-alanine supplements can produce pruritus
          (itchy skin), but the authors do not indicate the severity of this
          effect [<a href="#en59" class="fscopy_nounderline">59</a>]. There are
          no safety data on use of the supplement for more than 1 year [<a
            href="#en54"

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: There is insufficient expert consensus on
          the value of taking beta-alanine to enhance performance in intense,
          short-term activities or its safety, particularly when users take it
          regularly for at least several months. In a position statement, AND,
          DoC, and ACSM advise that beta-alanine supplementation might improve
          training capacity and does enhance performance, especially of
          high-intensity exercise lasting 60-240 seconds, that acid-base
          disturbances resulting from increased anaerobic glycolysis would
          otherwise impair [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>].
          In its position statement, ISSN concludes that beta-alanine
          supplementation improves exercise performance and attenuates
          neuromuscular fatigue [<a href="#en54" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >54</a

          alanine for improving sports performance in suitable athletic
          competitions under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but
          it notes that more research might be required to understand how the
          supplement should be used for best results [<a

        </p>

        <p>
          For healthy individuals willing to use beta-alanine supplements, ISSN
          recommends a daily loading dose of 4 to 6 g/day in divided doses of 2
          g or less for at least 2 weeks. The society states that bepnefits
          increase after 4 weeks, when muscle carnosine concentrations rise by
          40–60% [<a href="#en54" class="fscopy_nounderline">54</a>]. It advises
          users to take beta-alanine supplements with meals to augment muscle
          carnosine levels and to use divided lower doses or take a
          sustained-release form if paresthesia occurs.

        </p>

        <p>
          Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the
          branched-chain amino acid leucine. About 5% of the body’s leucine is
          converted into HMB, which is then converted in the liver to a
          precursor (known as beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A)
          needed for cholesterol biosynthesis [<a
            href="#en61"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >61</a
          >]. Some experts hypothesize that skeletal muscle cells that become
          stressed and damaged from exercise require an exogenous source of the
          coenzyme for synthesis of cholesterol in their cellular membranes to
          restore structure and function [<a
            href="#en62"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >62</a
          >,<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>]. Experts also
          believe that the conversion of leucine to HMB activates muscle protein
          synthesis and reduces protein breakdown [<a
            href="#en63"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >63</a
          >]. Supplementation is the only practical way to obtain 3 g/day HMB
          because one would otherwise need to consume over 600 g/day of
          high-quality protein (from 5 lb of beef tenderloin, for example) to
          obtain enough leucine (60 g) for conversion into HMB [<a
            href="#en63"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >63</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Although studies have investigated HMB for two
          decades, they have used substantially different periods of
          supplementation (1 day to 6 weeks) and daily doses (1.5 to 6 g; most
          commonly 3 g based on evidence that this dose provides equivalent
          results to 6 g and better results than 1.5 g) [<a
            href="#en61"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >61</a
          >,<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>,<a
            href="#en64"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >64</a
          >]. Studies also used participants of different ages (19 to 50 years),
          training status (e.g., untrained or trained athletes), training
          protocols (e.g., with machines or free weights), training duration (10
          days to 12 weeks), consumption of other supplements (such as
          creatine), and other factors. It is therefore difficult to predict
          what, if any, benefits an exercising individual might experience from
          consuming HMB.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is general agreement that HMB helps speed up recovery from
          exercise of sufficient amount and intensity to induce skeletal muscle
          damage [<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>,<a
            href="#en65"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >65</a
          >]. Therefore, trained athletes must exert themselves more than
          untrained individuals to potentially benefit from using the
          supplement. Some studies suggest that HMB use has additional benefits,
          including an ability to enhance strength, power, skeletal muscle
          hypertrophy, and aerobic performance in both trained and untrained
          people [<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: A review of safety data from nine studies found that
          users tolerate HMB well, and it is safe at daily intakes of 3 g for 3
          to 8 weeks in younger (ages 18–47 years) and older (ages 62–81) adults
          of both sexes who do or do not exercise [<a
            href="#en66"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >66</a
          >]. Assessments of blood chemistry, hematology, and emotional affect
          found no adverse effects. Another study randomized 37 untrained males
          aged 18–29 years participating in a resistance training program to
          take either no HMB or about 3–6 g/day HMB [<a
            href="#en62"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >62</a
          >]. Use of HMB did not alter or adversely affect any measured
          hematologic, hepatic, or renal-function parameters in these young men.
          Although 3 g/day HMB appears to be safe for short-term use in adults,
          its safety profile (and efficacy) has not been studied in adolescents
          [<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: There is no expert consensus on the value
          of taking HMB for several months or longer or its safety. HMB is not
          on a list of evidence-based ergogenic aids issued by the AND, DoC, and
          the ACSM [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>]. The
          Australian Institute of Sport does not recommend HMB supplementation
          by athletes, except as part of a research protocol or with proper
          monitoring [<a href="#en29" class="fscopy_nounderline">29</a>].
          However, ISSN notes that HMB can enhance recovery by reducing
          exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage in both trained and untrained
          individuals [<a href="#en63" class="fscopy_nounderline">63</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          HMB is available in two forms: as a mono-hydrated calcium salt
          (HMB-Ca) and a calcium-free form (HMB-free acid [HMB-FA]). HMB-Ca is
          approximately 13% calcium by weight, and a daily dose of 3 g/day adds
          about 400 mg calcium to the diet [<a
            href="#en66"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >66</a
          >]. Those who wish to limit their calcium intake can use HMB-FA [<a
            href="#en63"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >63</a
          >]. Although the latter form appears to have a faster and greater
          effect based on its ability to raise HMB plasma levels, more studies
          are needed to compare the effects of HMB-Ca with those of HMB-FA [<a
            href="#en63"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >63</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          The ISSN recommends that healthy adults interested in using HMB
          supplements take 1–2 g HMB-Ca 60 to 120 minutes before exercise or 1–2
          g HMB-FA 30 to 60 minutes before exercise [<a
            href="#en63"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >63</a
          >]. It also suggests that supplement users ideally consume 3 g/day HMB
          (in three equal servings of 1 g) for at least 2 weeks before
          high-intensity exercise to optimize HMB’s protective effects on
          muscle.

        <p>
          Betaine, also known as trimethylglycine, is found in foods such as
          beets, spinach, and whole-grain breads. Average daily intakes of
          betaine range from 100 to 300 mg/day [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >67</a
          >]. The mechanisms by which betaine might enhance exercise and
          athletic performance are not known, but many are hypothesized. For
          example, betaine might increase the biosynthesis of creatine, levels
          of blood nitric acid, and/or the water retention of cells [<a

        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: A limited number of small studies in men have
          assessed betaine in supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid.
          These studies, which typically examined strength- and power- based
          performance in bodybuilders and, occasionally, cyclists, provided
          conflicting results, and performance improvements tended to be modest
          [<a href="#en68" class="fscopy_nounderline">68-71</a>]. The typical
          dose of betaine that studies used ranged from 2 to 5 g/day [<a

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: The several small studies of athletes described in the
          previous paragraph who took betaine supplements for up to several
          weeks found no side effects or safety concerns. However, research has
          not adequately evaluated the safety of betaine.

          <u>Implications for use</u>: More research on betaine supplementation
          to enhance various types of performance, training protocols, and

        <p>
          Three essential amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are the
          branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whose name reflects their chemical
          structure. BCAAs make up approximately 25% of the amino acids in foods
          containing complete proteins (including all essential amino acids) [<a
            href="#en72"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >72</a

          fish, eggs, and milk (see section on <a href="#protein">protein</a>).
          BCAAs comprise about 14%–18% of the amino acids in human skeletal
          muscle proteins [<a href="#en73" class="fscopy_nounderline">73</a>].
          Unlike other essential amino acids, the BCAAs can be metabolized by
          mitochondria in skeletal muscle to provide energy during exercise [<a
            href="#en74"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >74</a
          >,<a href="#en75" class="fscopy_nounderline">75</a>]. The BCAAs,
          especially leucine, might also stimulate protein synthesis in
          exercised muscle [<a href="#en72" class="fscopy_nounderline">72</a>,<a
            href="#en76"

        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: The limited research on the potential ergogenic
          effects of the BCAAs has found little evidence to date that
          supplements of these amino acids improve performance in
          endurance-related aerobic events [<a
            href="#en75"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >75</a
          >]. The BCAAs might delay feelings of fatigue or help maintain mental
          focus by competing with the amino acid tryptophan (a precursor of the
          neurotransmitter serotonin that regulates mood and sleep) for entry
          into the brain, but this effect has not been well studied [<a
            href="#en72"

          weeks suggest that about 10–14 g/day supplemental BCAAs might enhance
          gains in muscle mass and strength during training [<a

          the ability of BCAAs to stimulate muscle protein synthesis beyond the
          capacity of sufficient dietary amounts of any high-quality protein to
          perform this function [<a href="#en76" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >76</a
          >]. Furthermore, it is not clear from existing research whether
          consumption of protein and BCAAs before versus after a workout affects
          their ability to maximize muscle protein synthesis and reduce protein
          catabolism [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>,<a

          leucine alone, studies suggest an upper safe limit of intake of 500
          mg/kg per day in healthy young and elderly men, or about 38 g/day for

          <u>Implications for use</u>: Studies have not consistently shown that
          taking supplements of BCAAs or any of their three constituent amino
          acids singly enhances exercise and athletic performance, builds muscle
          mass, or aids in recovery from exercise. Consuming animal foods
          containing complete proteins—or a combination of plant-based foods
          with complementary proteins that together provide all essential amino
          acids—automatically increases consumption of BCAAs (see section on
          <a href="#protein">protein</a>). This is also true of consuming
          protein powders made from complete proteins, especially whey, which

        <p>
          Caffeine is a methylated xanthine naturally found in variable amounts
          in coffee; tea; cacao pods (the source of chocolate); and other
          herbal/botanical sources, such as guarana, kola (or cola) nut, and
          yerba mate. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, muscles,
          and other organs, such as the heart, by binding to adenosine receptors
          on cells, thereby blocking the activity of adenosine, a neuromodulator
          with sedative-like properties [<a

          >,<a href="#en84" class="fscopy_nounderline">84</a>]. In this way,
          caffeine enhances arousal, increases vigor, and reduces fatigue [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"

            >13</a
          >,<a href="#en85" class="fscopy_nounderline">85</a>]. During the early
          stages of endurance exercise, caffeine might mobilize free fatty acids
          as a source of energy and spare muscle glycogen [<a
            href="#en38"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"

        </p>

        <p>
          Caffeine is commonly used in energy drinks and “shots” touted for
          their performance-enhancement effects [<a
            href="#en87"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >87</a
          >,<a href="#en88" class="fscopy_nounderline">88</a>]. It is also found
          in energy gels containing carbohydrates and electrolytes as well as in
          anhydrous caffeine-only pills.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Many studies have shown that caffeine might enhance
          performance in athletes when they ingest about 2–6 mg/kg body weight
          before exercise by improving endurance, strength, and power in
          high-intensity team sports activities [<a
            href="#en13"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"

            >89</a
          >,<a href="#en90" class="fscopy_nounderline">90</a>]. For an
          individual weighing 154 pounds (70 kg), this dose is equivalent to
          210–420 mg caffeine. Taking more, however, is unlikely to improve
          performance further and increases the risk of side effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          A review of the literature found that caffeine intake affected
          sport-specific performance (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, and
          rowing), as measured in time trials. Although 30 of the 33 trials
          showed positive improvements in performance, the improvements were not
          statistically significant in half of them [<a
            href="#en85"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >85</a
          >]. In these studies, performance improvement ranged from a decrease
          of 0.7% to an increase of 17.3%, suggesting that the caffeine was very
          helpful to some participants but slightly impaired performance in
          others. Factors such as the timing of ingestion, caffeine intake mode
          or form, and habituation to caffeine could also have accounted for the
          varied effects on performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Caffeine supplementation is more likely to help with endurance-type
          activities (such as running) and activities of long duration with
          intermittent activity (such as soccer) than more anaerobic, short-term
          bouts of intense exercise (such as sprinting or lifting weights) [<a
            href="#en91"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >91</a
          >]. Some evidence suggests that caffeine is more likely to improve
          performance in people who are not habituated to it [<a
            href="#en85"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >85</a
          >]. Limiting caffeine intake to 50 mg/day or abstaining from caffeine
          for 2–7 days before taking it for an athletic event might maximize any
          ergogenic effect. However, other evidence shows no habituation effect
          of caffeine consumption on performance [<a
            href="#en92"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >92</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Heavy caffeine use (500 mg/day or more) might diminish
          rather than enhance physical performance and could also disturb sleep
          and cause irritability and anxiety [<a
            href="#en93"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >93</a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >94-97</a
          >]. Caffeine does not induce diuresis or increase sweat loss during
          exercise and therefore does not reduce fluid balance in the body that
          would adversely affect performance [<a

          For healthy adults, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states
          that 400 mg/day caffeine does not usually have dangerous adverse
          effects [<a href="#en99" class="fscopy_nounderline">99</a>]. The
          American Medical Association recommends that adults limit their intake
          of caffeine to 500 mg/day and that adolescents consume no more than
          100 mg/day [<a href="#en100" class="fscopy_nounderline">100</a>]. The
          American Academy of Pediatrics warns that caffeine-containing energy
          drinks in particular “have no place in the diets of children or
          adolescents” and are not suitable for use during routine physical
          activity [<a href="#en101" class="fscopy_nounderline">101</a>].

        <p>
          Pure powdered caffeine is available as a dietary supplement and is
          very potent. A single tablespoon contains 10 g caffeine, and an acute
          oral dose of 10 to 14 g caffeine (approximately 150–200 mg/kg) can be
          fatal [<a href="#en91" class="fscopy_nounderline">91</a>].
          Furthermore, combining caffeine with other stimulants could increase
          the potential for adverse effects [<a

          <u>Implications for use</u>: Caffeine is easily and rapidly absorbed,
          even from the buccal membranes in the mouth, and is distributed
          throughout the body and brain. It reaches peak concentrations in the
          blood within 45 minutes of consumption and has a half-life of about
          4–5 hours [<a href="#en83" class="fscopy_nounderline">83</a>]. For a
          potential benefit to athletic performance, users should consume
          caffeine 15 to 60 minutes before exercise [<a

          In a position statement, AND, DoC, and ACSM state that caffeine

          supplementation at 2–6 mg/kg body weight is linked to enhanced
          physical performance and the effects of smaller doses usually last
          longer and are greater in people who do not usually consume caffeine
          [<a href="#en89" class="fscopy_nounderline">89</a>]. It adds that
          caffeine could reduce perceived exertion when exercise lasts longer.
          In a position statement, ISSN describes caffeine as effective in
          trained athletes for improving sports performance and notes that
          supplementation with about 3–6 mg/kg has an ergogenic effect on
          “sustained maximal endurance exercise” but not necessarily on
          “strength-power performance” [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"

          improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under
          the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more
          research might be required to understand how caffeine should be used

        </p>

        <p>
          L-citrulline is a nonessential amino acid produced in the body, mainly
          from glutamine, and obtained from the diet. Watermelon is the
          best-known source; 1 cup diced seedless watermelon has about 365 mg
          citrulline [<a href="#en108" class="fscopy_nounderline">108</a>].
          About 80% of the body’s citrulline is converted in the kidneys into
          arginine, another amino acid (see section on
          <a href="#arginine">arginine</a>) [<a
            href="#en30"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >30</a
          >]. The subsequent conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, a potent
          dilator of blood vessels, might be the mechanism by which citrulline
          could serve as an ergogenic aid. In fact, consumption of citrulline
          might be a more efficient way to raise blood arginine levels than
          consumption of arginine because more citrulline is absorbed from the
          gut than arginine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most studies have used citrulline malate, a combination of citrulline
          with malic acid (a constituent in many fruits that is also produced
          endogenously), because malate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle,
          might enhance energy production [<a

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: The research to support supplemental citrulline as an
          ergogenic aid is limited and conflicting at best. The few published
          studies have had heterogeneous designs and ranged in duration from 1
          to 16 days. As an example, in one randomized controlled study with a
          crossover design, 41 healthy male weight lifters aged 22–37 years
          consumed 8 g citrulline malate or a placebo 1 hour before completing
          barbell bench presses to exhaustion [<a
            href="#en109"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >109</a
          >]. Overall, participants could complete significantly more
          repetitions when taking the supplement and reported significantly less
          muscle soreness 1 and 2 days after the test. Another study that
          randomized 17 young healthy men and women to take citrulline without
          malate (either 3 g before testing or 9 g over 24 hours) or a placebo
          found that participants using the citrulline did not perform as well
          as those taking the placebo on an incremental treadmill test to
          exhaustion [<a href="#en110" class="fscopy_nounderline">110</a>].
          Although citrulline supplementation might increase plasma levels of
          nitric oxide metabolites, such a response has not been directly
          related to any improvement in athletic performance [<a

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Studies have not adequately assessed the safety of
          citrulline, particularly when users take it in supplemental form for
          months at a time. In the study of weight lifters described above, 6 of
          the 41 participants reported “stomach discomfort” after taking the
          supplement [<a href="#en109" class="fscopy_nounderline">109</a>].
          Additional short-term studies in which supplemental citrulline was
          provided to non-athletes at up to 6 g/day for 4 weeks and 1.35 g/day
          for 6 weeks found no adverse effects [<a

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: The research to date does not provide

          Dietary supplements that contain citrulline provide either citrulline
          or citrulline malate. Citrulline malate is 56.64% citrulline by weight
          so, for example, 1 g citrulline malate provides 566 mg of citrulline.
          Sellers of some citrulline malate dietary supplements claim that they
          provide a higher percentage of citrulline (with labels listing, for
          example, citrulline malate 2:1 or tri- citrulline malate), but studies
          have not determined whether these supplements are superior to standard
          citrulline or citrulline malate supplements.

          Creatine is one of the most thoroughly studied and widely used dietary
          supplements to enhance exercise and sports performance [<a
            href="#en112"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >112</a
          >]. Creatine is produced endogenously and obtained from the diet in
          small amounts. It helps generate ATP and thereby supplies the muscles
          with energy, particularly for short-term events [<a
            href="#en113"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >113</a
          >]. Creatine might improve muscle performance in four ways: by
          increasing stores of phosphocreatine used to generate ATP at the
          beginning of intense exercise, accelerating the re-synthesis of
          phosphocreatine after exercise, depressing the degradation of adenine
          nucleotides and the accumulation of lactate, and/or enhancing glycogen
          storage in skeletal muscles [<a
            href="#en113"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >113</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          The liver and kidneys synthesize about 1 g/day creatine from the amino
          acids glycine, arginine, and methionine [<a
            href="#en114"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >114</a
          >]. Animal-based foods, such as beef (2 g/lb), pork (2.3 g/lb), and
          salmon (2 g/lb), also contain creatine. A person weighing 154 pounds
          has about 120 g creatine and phosphocreatine in his or her body,
          almost all in the skeletal and cardiac muscles [<a
            href="#en112"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >112</a
          >]. However, it is only when users consume much greater amounts of
          creatine over time as a dietary supplement that it could have
          ergogenic effects. Metabolized creatine is converted into the waste
          product creatinine, which is eliminated from the body through the
          kidneys.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Studies in both laboratory and sports settings have
          found that short-term creatine supplementation (for 5 to 7 days) in
          both men and women often significantly increases strength (e.g., for
          bench presses) and power (e.g., for cycling), work involving multiple
          sets of maximal effort muscle contractions, and sprinting and soccer
          performance [<a href="#en112" class="fscopy_nounderline">112</a>,<a
            href="#en115"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >115</a
          >]. In one example, a study randomized 14 healthy, resistance-trained
          men (aged 19–29 years) to receive 25 g creatine monohydrate or a
          placebo for 6–7 days [<a href="#en116" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >116</a
          >]. Participants taking the supplement had significant improvements in
          peak power output during all five sets of jump squats and in
          repetitions during all five sets of bench presses on three occasions.
          In another study, 18 well-trained male sprinters aged 18–24 years
          received either 20 g/day creatine or a placebo for 5 days [<a
            href="#en117"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >117</a
          >]. Compared with those taking the placebo, participants taking the
          creatine improved their performance in both 100- meter sprints and six
          intermittent 60 m sprints.
        </p>

        <p>
          Supplementation with creatine over weeks or months helps training
          adaptations to structured, increased workloads over time. For example,
          in a randomized study of 14 female collegiate soccer players during
          the off-season, those who received creatine (15 g/day for 1 week and
          then 5 g/day for 12 weeks) had significantly greater increases in
          muscle strength, as measured by bench press and full-squat maximal
          strength testing, but not lean tissue compared with participants who
          took a placebo [<a href="#en118" class="fscopy_nounderline">118</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Individuals have varied responses to creatine supplementation, based
          on factors such as diet and the relative percentages of various muscle
          fiber types [<a href="#en114" class="fscopy_nounderline">114</a>,<a
            href="#en119"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >119</a
          >]. Vegetarians, for example, with their lower muscle creatine
          content, might have greater responses to supplementation than meat
          eaters. Overall, creatine enhances performance during repeated short
          bursts of high-intensity, intermittent activity, such as sprinting and
          weight lifting, where energy for this predominantly anaerobic exercise
          comes mainly from the ATP-creatine phosphate energy system [<a
            href="#en38"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >38</a
          >,<a href="#en114" class="fscopy_nounderline">114</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Creatine supplementation seems to be of little value for endurance
          sports, such as distance running or swimming, that do not depend on
          the short-term ATP-creatine phosphate system to provide short-term
          energy, and it leads to weight gain that might impede performance in
          such sports [<a href="#en113" class="fscopy_nounderline">113</a>,<a
            href="#en114"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >114</a
          >]. Furthermore, in predominantly aerobic exercise lasting more than
          150 seconds, the body relies on oxidative phosphorylation as the
          primary energy source, a metabolic pathway that does not require
          creatine [<a href="#en114" class="fscopy_nounderline">114</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Studies have found no consistent set of side effects
          from creatine use, except that it often leads to weight gain, because
          it increases water retention and possibly stimulates muscle protein
          synthesis [<a href="#en112" class="fscopy_nounderline">112</a>,<a
            href="#en113"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >113</a
          >]. Several studies have found that supplemental creatine monohydrate,
          when used for a strength-training program, can lead to a 1–2 kg
          increase in total body weight in a month [<a
            href="#en73"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"

        </p>

        <p>
          Creatine is considered safe for short-term use by healthy adults [<a
            href="#en12"

          evidence shows that use of the product for several years is safe [<a
            href="#en112"

            >112</a
          >,<a href="#en120" class="fscopy_nounderline">120-122</a>]. Anecdotal
          reactions to creatine use include nausea, diarrhea and related
          gastrointestinal distress, muscle cramps, and heat intolerance.
          Creatine supplementation may reduce the range of motion of various
          parts of the body (such as the shoulders, ankles, and lower legs) and
          lead to muscle stiffness and resistance to stretching [<a
            href="#en114"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >114</a
          >]. Adequate hydration while taking creatine might minimize these
          uncommon risks [<a href="#en113" class="fscopy_nounderline">113</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: In a position statement, AND, DoC, and
          ACSM advise that creatine enhances performance of cycles of
          high-intensity exercise followed by short recovery periods and
          improves training capacity [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >12</a
          >]. In its position statement, ISSN states that creatine monohydrate
          is the most effective nutritional supplement currently available for
          enhancing capacity for high- intensity exercise and lean body mass
          during exercise [<a href="#en112" class="fscopy_nounderline">112</a>].
          The ISSN contends that athletes who supplement with creatine have a
          lower incidence of injuries and exercise-related side effects compared
          to those who do not take creatine [<a
            href="#en112"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >112</a
          >]. The Australian Institute of Sport supports the use of creatine for
          improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions under
          the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that more
          research might be required to understand how the supplement should be
          used for best results [<a href="#en29" class="fscopy_nounderline"

          A typical protocol for creatine supplementation in adults, regardless
          of sex or body size, consists of a loading phase for 5–7 days, when
          users consume 20 g/day creatine monohydrate in four portions of 5 g,
          followed by a maintenance phase of 3–5 g/day [<a
            href="#en112"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >112-114</a
          >]. In some studies, the loading dose is based on body weight (e.g.,
          0.3 g/kg) [<a href="#en114" class="fscopy_nounderline">114</a>].
          Another creatine supplementation protocol consists of taking single
          doses of about 3–6 g/day (0.03–0.1 g/kg body weight) for 3 to 4 weeks,
          without a loading phase, to produce ergogenic effects [<a

          Creatine monohydrate, which is 88% creatine by weight, is the most

          Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid hormone secreted by the
          adrenal cortex. The body can convert DHEA to the male hormone

          female hormone estradiol [<a href="#en129" class="fscopy_nounderline"

          improve the physical performance of athletes, regular and occasional
          exercisers, and largely sedentary individuals. In almost all cases,
          the studies found that <em>Panax ginseng</em> in various doses and
          preparations had no ergogenic effect on such measures as peak power
          output, time to exhaustion, perceived exertion, recovery from intense

          One review of studies of the effects of Siberian ginseng on endurance

          up to 120 minutes [<a href="#en133" class="fscopy_nounderline">133</a

          with nine male college tennis players found that 800 mg/day Siberian
          ginseng (prepared from the root and rhizome) for 8 weeks significantly
          improved endurance in a cycling trial, elevated VO<sub>2</sub>max and

          Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle, blood, and the

          from the BCAAs, and an adult consumes about 3–6 g/day in
          protein-containing foods [<a href="#en139" class="fscopy_nounderline"

          either glutamine (0.9 g/kg lean body mass, or almost 45 g/day) or
          placebo while completing a 6-week strength-training program. There
          were no significant differences between the two groups in measures of
          strength, torque, or lean tissue mass, demonstrating that glutamine
          had no effect on muscle performance, body composition, or
          muscle-protein degradation. Another study compared the effect of
          glutamine (four doses of 0.3 g/kg body weight over 3 days) or placebo
          in 16 young adult men and women on recovery from eccentric exercise

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >143</a

          loss, accelerated strength recovery, and diminished muscle soreness
          more quickly than placebo; these effects were more pronounced in the
          men. Some athletes use glutamine supplements in the hope that they
          will attenuate exercise-induced immune impairment and reduce their
          risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections. However, there
          is little research-based support for this benefit [<a

          <u>Safety</u>: In the studies described above, the glutamine had no
          reported side effects. Many patients with serious catabolic illnesses,
          such as infections, intestinal diseases, and burns, take glutamine
          safely as part of their medical care. Daily oral doses ranging from
          0.21 to 0.42 g/kg body weight glutamine (equivalent to 15–30 g/day in
          a person weighing 154 pounds) have provided no biochemical or clinical

          Iron is an essential mineral and a structural component of hemoglobin,
          an erythrocyte protein that transfers oxygen from the lungs to the
          tissues, and myoglobin, a protein in muscles that provides them with
          oxygen. Iron is also necessary to metabolize substrates for energy as
          a component of cytochromes and to dehydrogenase enzymes involved in
          substrate oxidation [<a href="#en144" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >144</a

          Iron balance is an important consideration for athletes who must pay
          attention to both iron intakes and iron losses. Teenage girls and
          premenopausal women are at increased risk of obtaining insufficient
          amounts of iron from their diets. They require more iron than teenage
          boys and men because they lose considerable iron due to menstruation,
          and they might not eat sufficient amounts of iron-containing foods [<a

          activity produces acute inflammation that reduces iron absorption from
          the gut and iron use via a peptide, hepcidin, that regulates iron
          homeostasis. Iron is also lost in sweat. The destruction of
          erythrocytes in the feet because of frequent striking on hard surfaces
          leads to foot-strike hemolysis. Also, use of antiinflammatories and
          pain medications can lead to some blood loss from the gastrointestinal
          tract, thereby decreasing iron stores.

        <p>
          The richest dietary sources of heme iron (which is highly
          bioavailable) include lean meats and seafood. Plant-based foods—such
          as nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified grain products—contain
          non-heme iron, which is less bioavailable than heme iron.

          treatments (provided orally or by injection) improved iron status and
          aerobic capacity in iron-deficient but non- anemic endurance athletes
          identified 19 studies involving 80 men and 363 women with a mean age
          of 22 years. Iron treatments improved iron status as expected, but
          they did not guarantee improvement in aerobic capacity or indices of
          endurance performance [<a href="#en153" class="fscopy_nounderline"

          assigned fewer than 20 women to a treatment or control group) and had
          a risk of bias. Based on the limited data and heterogenicity of
          results, the study authors suggested that preventing and treating iron
          deficiency could improve the performance of female athletes in sports
          that require endurance, maximal power output, and strength.

          <u>Safety</u>: Athletes can safely obtain recommended intakes of iron
          by consuming a healthy diet containing iron-rich foods and by taking
          an iron-containing dietary supplement as needed. High doses of iron
          may be prescribed for several weeks or months to treat iron

        <p>
          Protein is necessary to build, maintain, and repair muscle. Exercise
          increases intramuscular protein oxidation and breakdown, after which
          muscle-protein synthesis increases for up to a day or two [<a
            href="#en155"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >155</a
          >]. Regular resistance exercise results in the accretion of
          myofibrillar protein (the predominant proteins in skeletal muscle) and
          an increase in skeletal muscle fiber size. Aerobic exercise leads to
          more modest protein accumulation in working muscle, primarily in the
          mitochondria, which enhances oxidative capacity (oxygen use) for
          future workouts [<a href="#en155" class="fscopy_nounderline">155</a

        </p>

        <p>
          Athletes must consider both protein quality and quantity to meet their
          needs for the nutrient. They must obtain essential amino acids (EAAs)
          from the diet or from supplementation to support muscle growth,
          maintenance, and repair [<a href="#en155" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >155</a
          >]. The nine EAAs are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,
          methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Most
          complete proteins (those that contain all EAAs) are composed of about
          40% EAAs, so a meal or snack with 25 g total protein provides about 10
          g EAAs.

          acids <a href="#arginine">arginine</a> and

          <a href="#bcaa">BCAAs</a> (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). The
          potential of these amino acids to enhance exercise and athletic
          performance is not related to their incorporation into proteins.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Adequate protein in the diet is required to provide
          the EAAs necessary for muscle-protein synthesis and to minimize
          muscle-protein breakdown. Dietary protein consumption increases the
          concentration of amino acids in the blood, which muscle cells then
          take up. Sufficient protein is necessary primarily to optimize the
          training response to, and the recovery period after, exercise [<a

        <p>
          Muscle protein synthesis leading to increases in strength and muscle
          mass appears to be optimal with the consumption of high-quality
          protein (providing about 10 g EAAs) within 0–2 hours after exercise,
          in the early recovery phase [<a
            href="#en12"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >12</a
          >]. However, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that
          ingesting protein within an hour before or after exercise does not
          significantly increase muscle strength or size or facilitate muscle
          repair or remodeling [<a href="#en77" class="fscopy_nounderline">77</a
          >]. The period after exercise when protein intake reduces muscle
          protein breakdown, builds muscle, and increases mitochondrial proteins
          to enhance oxygen use by working muscles (the so-called “window of
          anabolic opportunity”) can last for up to 24 hours [<a

          Several studies in people engaged in resistance training show that
          consuming some protein before sleep can increase the rate of protein
          synthesis during the night and/or augment muscle mass and strength [<a

          >]. Participants in these studies consumed a bedtime drink containing
          27.5 or 40 g of the milk protein casein, which increased circulating
          amino acid levels throughout the night. Some studies show increased
          muscle protein synthesis when plasma levels of amino acids are raised
          [<a href="#en76" class="fscopy_nounderline">76</a>].

          <u>Safety</u>: The Food and Nutrition Board has not set a UL for
          protein, noting that the risk of adverse effects from excess protein
          from food is “very low” [<a href="#en160" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >160</a
          >]. However, it advises caution for those obtaining high protein
          intakes from foods and supplements because of the limited data on
          their potential adverse effects. High-protein diets (e.g., those
          providing two to three times the RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day for healthy
          adults and 0.85 g/kg/day for adolescents) do not appear to increase
          the risk of renal stones or dehydration; compromise renal function;
          reduce bone health; or, when consumed for several months, alter
          glomerular filtration rate or blood levels of lipids, glucose,
          creatine, or blood urea nitrogen [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >160-164</a

          have no consequence for long-term bone health [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"

          slightly more calcium.

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: Many foods—including meats, poultry,
          seafood, eggs, dairy products, beans, and nuts—contain protein.
          Protein powders and drinks are also available, most of which contain
          whey, one of the complete proteins isolated from milk [<a
            href="#en166"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >166</a
          >]. Digestion of casein, the main complete protein in milk, is slower
          than that of whey, so the release of amino acids from casein into the
          blood is slower [<a href="#en72" class="fscopy_nounderline">72</a>].
          Soy protein lacks the EAA methionine and might lose some cysteine and
          lysine in processing; rice protein lacks the EAA isoleucine [<a
            href="#en166"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >166</a
          >]. Many protein supplements consist of a combination of these protein
          sources. All EAAs are necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis,
          so users should select singular or complementary protein sources
          accordingly. To maximize muscle adaptations to training, AND, DoC, and
          ACSM recommend that athletes consume 0.3 g/kg body weight of
          high-quality protein (e.g., about 20 g for a person weighing 150 lb) 0
          to 2 hours after exercise and then every 3 to 5 hours [<a

        </p>

        <p>
          Since the Food and Nutrition Board developed the RDA for protein, more
          recent data have suggested that athletes require a daily protein
          intake of 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg to support metabolic adaptations, muscle
          repair and remodeling, and protein turnover [<a
            href="#en12"

            >12</a
          >,<a href="#en167" class="fscopy_nounderline">167</a>]. Athletes might
          benefit from even greater amounts for short periods of intense
          training or when they reduce their energy intake to improve physique
          or achieve a competition weight [<a
            href="#en12"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >12</a
          >]. The 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
          showed that the average daily intake of protein by adult men is 100 g
          and by women is 69 g [<a href="#en168" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >168</a
          >]. Athletes who require additional protein can obtain it by consuming
          more protein-containing foods and, if needed, protein supplements and
          protein-fortified food and beverage products.

          Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonol that is naturally present in a
          variety of fruits (such as apples), vegetables (such as onions), and
          beverages (such as wine and, especially, tea). An analysis of National
          Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002 data found that
          estimated daily total flavonol (including quercetin) consumption by
          adults averaged about 13 mg/day [<a

            >169</a
          >]. The mechanisms by which quercetin might enhance exercise and
          athletic performance when taken in much larger amounts are not known,
          but many have been hypothesized. For example, quercetin might increase
          the number of mitochondria in muscle, reduce oxidative stress,
          decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function (blood flow)
          [<a href="#en170" class="fscopy_nounderline">170</a>,<a

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Numerous small studies have assessed quercetin in
          supplemental form as a potential ergogenic aid in young adult, mostly
          male, participants. These studies typically examined the endurance
          performance and VO<sub>2</sub>max of participants engaged in aerobic
          activities, such as running or cycling trials, who received either
          quercetin (most often 1,000 mg/day) or placebo for 1 to 8 weeks [<a

          effects of quercetin supplementation were inconsistent and varied by
          study, but they generally ranged from no ergogenic benefit to only a
          trivial or small improvement that might not be meaningful in
          real-world (in contrast to laboratory) exercise conditions [<a

          participants cited in the previous paragraph who took as much as 1,000
          mg/day quercetin for up to 2 months found no side effects or safety
          concerns. The safety of longer-term use of that amount of quercetin or
          more has not been studied. FDA considers up to 500 mg/serving
          quercetin to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an ingredient
          in foods such as beverages, processed fruits and fruit juices, grain

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >75</a

          <a id="sodium"></a><strong><em>Sodium bicarbonate</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Sodium bicarbonate is commonly known as baking soda. The consumption
          of several teaspoons of sodium bicarbonate over a short time
          temporarily increases blood pH by acting as a buffering agent. The
          precise mechanism by which this induced alkalosis leads to an
          ergogenic response to exercise is unclear. It is thought that
          “bicarbonate loading” enhances disposal of hydrogen ions that
          accumulate and efflux from working muscles as they generate energy in
          the form of ATP via anaerobic glycolysis from high-intensity exercise,
          thereby reducing the metabolic acidosis that contributes to fatigue
          [<a href="#en180" class="fscopy_nounderline">180</a>,<a
            href="#en181"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >181</a
          >]. As a result, supplementation with sodium bicarbonate might improve
          performance in short-term, intense exercises (e.g., sprinting and
          swimming) and in intermittently intense sports (e.g., boxing and
          tennis).
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Many studies have assessed sodium bicarbonate as an
          ergogenic aid in swimmers, cyclists, rowers, boxers, tennis and rugby
          players, judo practitioners, and others [<a
            href="#en180"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >180-182</a
          >]. These studies usually included a small number of participants who
          underwent one or more trials in a laboratory over several days.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the research results are conflicting, the activities and
          individuals most likely to benefit from sodium bicarbonate
          supplementation in real-world conditions is not clear. Reviewers of
          these studies generally agree that taking about 300 mg/kg body weight
          sodium bicarbonate might provide a minor to moderate performance
          benefit in strenuous exercise over several minutes and in sports that
          involve intermittent, high-intensity activity [<a
            href="#en180"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >180-182</a
          >]. However, individuals have varied responses to bicarbonate loading;
          the practice does not benefit some users, and it can worsen rather
          than enhance performance in others. Recreationally active individuals,
          in particular, might find the supplements to be ergogenic for one
          exercise session but not another. Many study findings suggest that
          supplementation with sodium bicarbonate is most likely to improve the
          performance of trained athletes [<a

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: The main side effect of sodium bicarbonate
          supplementation in gram quantities is gastrointestinal distress,
          including nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Supplement
          users can reduce or minimize this distress by consuming the total dose
          in smaller amounts multiple times over an hour with fluid and a snack
          of carbohydrate-rich food [<a href="#en180" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >180</a
          >,<a href="#en183" class="fscopy_nounderline">183</a>]. Sodium
          bicarbonate is 27.4% sodium by weight; 1 teaspoon (4.6 g) contains
          1,259 mg sodium. A 70-kg individual ingesting a recommended dose of
          300 mg/kg body weight would consume approximately 5,750 mg sodium.
          Such a large intake of sodium with fluid can lead to temporary
          hyperhydration, which could be useful in activities where large sweat
          losses might otherwise lead to significant fluid deficits. However,
          the slight increase in body weight from fluid retention might hinder
          performance in other sports [<a

          long-term use of sodium bicarbonate as an ergogenic aid over months or
          longer.

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: The amount of sodium bicarbonate in
          recommended servings of dietary supplements—about 300 mg/kg body
          weight, or the equivalent of 4–5 teaspoons of baking soda for most
          individuals taken 1–2 hours before exercise in one or multiple doses
          as a pill or as a powder mixed with a flavored fluid—is generally much
          less than the quantity that could enhance exercise and athletic
          performance. Many athletes find this amount of sodium bicarbonate
          powder dissolved in fluid to be unpalatably salty [<a

          for improving sports performance in suitable athletic competitions
          under the direction of an expert in sports medicine, but it notes that
          more research might be required to understand how the supplement

          The Montmorency variety of tart or sour cherry (<em>Prunus cerasus</em

          as quercetin. Researchers hypothesize that these compounds have
          antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects that might facilitate
          exercise recovery by reducing pain and inflammation, strength loss and
          muscle damage from intense activity, and hyperventilation trauma from

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Much of the limited research on use of tart cherry to

          about a week before a test of strength (such as single-leg extensions
          or back squats); participants continue taking the supplements for
          about 2 days after the test. Study results vary, but the benefits
          appear to include more rapid recovery of strength and/or lower

          ml/day; the equivalent of 100–120 whole cherries) or a placebo for a

          levels of blood markers of inflammation and muscle catabolism than the
          placebo takers, but perceptions of soreness of the quadriceps muscles
          did not differ significantly between the groups.

        <p>
          Further research is needed to determine the value of tart-cherry
          products for enhancing performance and recovery from intense exercise
          or participation in sports—especially when used on a regular basis—and
          the amounts of supplement, juice, or concentrate needed to provide any
          benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: Studies have not identified any side effects of the
          fresh tart-cherry juice or concentrate or of supplements of dried
          tart-cherry-skin powder. However, they have not adequately assessed
          the safety of tart-cherry dietary supplements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: There is no expert consensus on the value

          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> (common names include bindii,
          goat’s-head, bullhead, and tackweed), is a fruit-bearing plant that is
          most common in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe. It has been used
          since ancient times in Greece, China, and Asia to treat low libido and
          infertility [<a href="#en190" class="fscopy_nounderline">190</a>].
          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> extracts contain many compounds,
          including steroidal saponins [<a
            href="#en191"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >191</a
          >]. Some marketers claim that <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> enhances
          exercise and athletic performance by increasing serum concentrations
          of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, but studies have not
          adequately determined its potential mechanisms of action [<a
            href="#en192"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"

          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Efficacy</u>: Only a few small, short-term clinical trials have
          investigated <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> as an ergogenic aid [<a
            href="#en192"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >192</a
          >], and none since 2007. In one study, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg
          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> or a placebo taken for 4 weeks by men
          aged 20–36 years did not raise levels of either hormone [<a
            href="#en193"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >193</a
          >]. A study in 15 resistance-trained men found no differences among
          those taking 3.21 mg/kg <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> or placebo for 8
          weeks in improvements in bench and leg press scores or in muscle mass
          [<a href="#en194" class="fscopy_nounderline">194</a>]. In 22 elite
          male rugby players aged 19.8 years, on average, who were randomly
          assigned to take 450 mg/day <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> or a placebo
          for 5 weeks, the supplement did not have a superior effect on strength
          or lean body mass [<a href="#en192" class="fscopy_nounderline">192</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Safety</u>: The only toxicity studies of
          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> were conducted in animals, where
          unspecified high intakes led to severe heart, liver, and kidney damage
          [<a href="#en190" class="fscopy_nounderline">190</a>]. The clinical
          studies described above found no side effects of
          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em>. One case report involved a morbidly
          obese Iranian man, age 28, who consumed 2 L/day
          <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> water for 2 days before being
          hospitalized with seizures, severe weakness in the legs, malaise, and
          poor appetite [<a href="#en195" class="fscopy_nounderline">195</a>].
          Subsequent tests indicated hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and
          neurotoxicity. The man’s condition improved after he discontinued the
          water, but the water was not tested to determine the presence or
          amount of <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> or any other potential toxin or
          contaminant.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Implications for use</u>: The Australian Institute of Sport advises
          against the use of <em>Tribulus terrestris</em> by athletes, noting
          that this supplement and other claimed testosterone boosters are
          banned from athletic competitions or have a high risk of being
          contaminated with substances that, if ingested, could lead to positive
          drug-screening results [<a href="#en196" class="fscopy_nounderline"

        <p>
          The published biomedical literature provides no support for the
          efficacy and insufficient support for the safety of

        <h2 id="h3">Ingredients Banned from Dietary Supplements</h2>

        <p>
          This section provides examples of ingredients that the FDA currently
          prohibits in dietary supplements and that some consumers have used in
          the past as ergogenic aids, despite the lack of evidence supporting
          their use.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><em>Androstenedione</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Androstenedione is an anabolic steroid precursor, or prohormone, that
          the body converts to testosterone (which induces muscle growth) and
          estrogen [<a href="#en197" class="fscopy_nounderline">197</a>]. Major
          League Baseball slugger Mark McGwire popularized androstenedione as an
          ergogenic aid in 1998 [<a href="#en198" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >198</a
          >]. However, two randomized clinical trials found no performance
          benefits from androstenedione supplements. In one study, 10 healthy
          young men (ages 19–29 years) took a single 100-mg dose of
          androstenedione. Another 20 were randomized to receive either 300
          mg/day androstenedione or a placebo for 6 of 8 weeks while undergoing
          resistance-training and muscle-strengthening exercises [<a
            href="#en199"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >199</a
          >]. The short-term or longer-term use of the supplement did not affect
          serum testosterone concentrations, nor did it produce any
          significantly greater gains in resistance-training performance, muscle
          strength, or lean body mass. However, participants who took
          androstenedione for the 6 weeks experienced significant declines in
          their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and
          significant increases in serum estrogens. A similar study randomized
          50 men (ages 35–65 years) to take 200 mg/day androstenedione, 200
          mg/day of the related androstenediol, or a placebo for 12 weeks while
          participating in a high-intensity resistance training program [<a
            href="#en200"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >200</a
          >]. The supplements did not improve participants’ muscular strength or
          lean body mass compared with placebo, but they significantly decreased
          HDL cholesterol levels and raised levels of serum estrogens. Among
          participants taking the androstenedione, testosterone levels increased
          significantly by 16% after 1 month of use but declined to
          pre-treatment levels by 12 weeks, in part due to downregulation of
          endogenous testosterone synthesis.
        </p>

        <p>
          In March 2004, FDA warned companies to cease distributing
          androstenedione-containing dietary supplements. The rationale was the
          lack of sufficient information to establish that such products could
          reasonably be expected to be safe and that FDA had never approved
          androstenedione as a new dietary ingredient permitted in supplements
          [<a href="#en197" class="fscopy_nounderline">197</a>]. The U.S.
          Department of Justice classified androstenedione as a Schedule III
          controlled substance (defined as a drug with a moderate to low
          potential for physical and psychological dependence) in 2004 [<a
            href="#en201"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >201</a
          >]. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, International
          Olympic Committee, and World Anti-Doping Agency ban the use of
          androstenedione [<a href="#en128" class="fscopy_nounderline">128</a

        <p>
          <strong><em>Dimethylamylamine</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) is a stimulant formerly included in some
          pre-workout and other dietary supplements claimed to enhance exercise
          performance and build muscle. Studies have not evaluated DMAA in
          humans as a potential ergogenic aid. In 2013, FDA declared products
          containing this ingredient to be illegal after it received 86 reports
          of deaths and illnesses associated with dietary supplements containing
          DMAA. These reports described heart problems as well as nervous system
          and psychiatric disorders [<a href="#en202" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >202</a
          >]. Furthermore, FDA had never approved DMAA as a new dietary
          ingredient that would reasonably be expected to be safe [<a
            href="#en202"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >202</a
          >]. Although products marketed as dietary supplements containing DMAA
          are illegal in the United States, discontinued, reformulated, or even
          new products containing DMAA might still be found in the U.S.
          marketplace. The Department of Defense’s Human Performance Resource
          Center maintains a list of currently available products that contain
          DMAA or are labeled as containing DMAA, 1-3-dimethylamylamine, or an
          equivalent chemical or marketing name (e.g., methylhexaneamine or
          geranium extract) [<a href="#en203" class="fscopy_nounderline">203</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          The FDA also determined that dietary supplements containing
          1,3-dimethybutylamine (DMBA), a stimulant chemically related to DMAA,
          are adulterated. As with DMAA, FDA had never approved this stimulant
          as a new dietary ingredient. The agency contended that there is no
          history of use or data offering sufficient assurance that this
          compound is not associated with “a significant or unreasonable risk of
          illness or injury” [<a href="#en204" class="fscopy_nounderline">204</a

        <p>
          Ephedra (also known as ma huang), a plant native to China, contains
          ephedrine alkaloids, which are stimulant compounds; the primary
          alkaloid is ephedrine [<a href="#en206" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >206</a
          >]. In the 1990s, ephedra—frequently combined with caffeine—was a
          popular ingredient in dietary supplements sold to enhance exercise and
          athletic performance and to promote weight loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          No studies have evaluated the use of ephedra dietary supplements, with
          or without caffeine, as ergogenic aids. Instead, available studies
          have used the related synthetic compound ephedrine together with
          caffeine and typically measured the effects 1–2 hours after a single
          dose [<a href="#en207" class="fscopy_nounderline">207</a>,<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >208</a
          >]. These studies showed that the ephedrine–caffeine combination
          produced a 20–30% increase in power and endurance, but ephedrine alone
          had no significant effects on exercise-performance parameters, such as
          oxygen consumption or time to exhaustion [<a
            href="#en208"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >208</a
          >]. No data show any sustained improvement in athletic performance
          over time with continued dosing of ephedrine with caffeine [<a
            href="#en207"
            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >207</a
          >].
        </p>

        <p>
          Ephedra use has been associated with death and serious adverse
          effects, including nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms (such as
          anxiety and mood change), hypertension, palpitations, stroke,
          seizures, and heart attack [<a

          banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids
          in the United States because they are associated with “an unreasonable
          risk of illness or injury” [<a

          amounts that lead to urine concentrations of ephedrine (or the related
          methylephedrine) exceeding 10 mcg/ml [<a

          Regulation of Dietary Supplements to Enhance Exercise and Athletic

        </h2>

        <p>
          The FDA regulates dietary supplements for exercise and athletic
          performance in accordance with the Dietary Supplement Health and
          Education Act of 1994 [<a href="#en209" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >209</a
          >]. Like other dietary supplements, exercise- and athletic-performance
          supplements differ from over-the-counter or prescription medications
          in that they do not require premarket review or approval by FDA.
          Supplement manufacturers are responsible for determining that their
          products are safe and their label claims are truthful and not
          misleading, although they are not required to provide this evidence to
          FDA before marketing their products. If FDA finds a supplement to be
          unsafe, it may remove the product from the market or ask the
          manufacturer to voluntarily recall the product. The FDA and Federal
          Trade Commission (FTC) may also take regulatory actions against
          manufacturers that make unsubstantiated physical-performance or other
          claims about their products.
        </p>

        <p>
          The FDA permits dietary supplements to contain only “dietary
          ingredients,” such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, and
          other botanicals. It does not permit these products to contain
          pharmaceutical ingredients, and manufacturers may not promote them to
          diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease [<a

          Like all dietary supplements, supplements used to enhance exercise and
          athletic performance can have side effects and might interact with
          prescription and over-the-counter medications. In some cases, the
          active constituents of botanical or other ingredients promoted as
          ergogenic aids are unknown or uncharacterized. Furthermore, many such
          products contain multiple ingredients that have not been adequately
          tested in combination with one another. People interested in taking
          dietary supplements to enhance their exercise and athletic performance
          should talk with their healthcare providers about the use of these
          products.

          The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the U.S.

        <p>
          The FDA requires the manufacture of dietary supplements to comply with
          quality standards that ensure that these products contain only the
          labeled ingredients and amounts and are free of undeclared substances
          and unsafe levels of contaminants [<a

          for bodybuilding are among those most often adulterated with
          undeclared or deceptively labeled ingredients, such as synthetic
          anabolic steroids or prescription medications [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >212</a
          >]. As one example, some products sold for bodybuilding are
          adulterated with selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs); these
          synthetic drugs are designed to mimic the effects of testosterone [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >213</a

          disqualification of athletes from competition if a drug test shows
          that they have consumed prohibited substances, even if they have done
          so unknowingly. FDA has warned against the use of any body- building
          products that claim to contain steroids or steroid-like substances [<a

          Some dietary-supplement firms have hired third-party certification
          companies to verify the identity and content of their supplements to
          enhance exercise and athletic performance, thus providing some extra,
          independent assurance that the products contain the labeled amounts of
          ingredients and are free of many banned substances and drugs. The
          major companies providing this certification service are NSF (nsf.org)
          through its Certified for Sport® program, Informed-Choice
          (informed-choice.org), and the Banned Substances Control Group
          (bscg.org). The products that meet the requirements of these companies
          may carry the certifier’s official logo and are listed on the
          certifier’s website.

          Some ingredients in dietary supplements used to enhance exercise and
          athletic performance can interact with certain medications. For
          example, intakes of large doses of antioxidant supplements, such as
          vitamins C and E, during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy could
          reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular
          oxidative damage in cancerous cells [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"

          warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) [<a

            class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >216</a
          >]. Iron supplements can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa (used
          to treat Parkinson’s disease) and levothyroxine (Levothyroid, Levoxyl,
          Synthroid, and others, for hypothyroidism and goiter), so users should
          take iron supplements at a different time of the day than these two
          drugs [<a href="#en217" class="fscopy_nounderline">217</a>,<a

            >218</a
          >]. Cimetidine (Tagamet HB, used to treat duodenal ulcers) can slow
          the rate of caffeine clearance from the body and thereby increase the
          risk of adverse effects from caffeine consumption [<a

          Individuals taking dietary supplements and medications on a regular
          basis should discuss the use of these products with their healthcare

          Choosing a Sensible Approach to Enhance Exercise and Athletic
          Performance
        </h2>

        <p>
          According to AND, DoC, and ACSM, sound science supports the use of
          only a few dietary supplements whose labels claim ergogenic benefits
          [<a href="#en12" class="fscopy_nounderline">12</a>]. These
          organizations add that the best way to use supplements is as additions
          to a carefully chosen diet, that dietary supplements rarely have
          ergogenic benefits when not used in these conditions, and that there
          is no justification for their use by young athletes. The National
          Federation of State High School Associations also expresses strong
          opposition to the use of supplements to enhance athletic performance
          by high school students [<a href="#en15" class="fscopy_nounderline"
            >15</a
          >]. The American Academy of Pediatrics adds that performance-enhancing
          substances do not result in significant improvements in most teenaged
          athletes beyond those that can result from proper nutrition and
          training basics [<a href="#en7" class="fscopy_nounderline">7</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
          Elite and recreational athletes perform at their best and recover most
          quickly when they consume a nutritionally adequate diet with
          sufficient fluids and when they have appropriate physical conditioning
          and proper training.
